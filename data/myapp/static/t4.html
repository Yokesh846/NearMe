    The Nellaiappar Temple is a Hindu temple dedicated to the deity Shiva, located in Tirunelveli, 
    a city in the South Indian state of Tamil Nadu. Shiva is worshipped as Nellaiappar (also called
     Venuvananathar) represented by the lingam and his consort Parvati is depicted as Kanthimathi Amman.
      The deity Vishnu is also worshipped here, having witnessed their wedding according to legend. Hence,
       this temple is regarded as an abhimana kshetram of Vaishnavism. The temple is located on the northern
        banks of Thamirabarani River in Tirunelveli district. The presiding deity is revered in the 7th century 
        Tamil Saiva canonical work, the Tevaram, written by Tamil saint poets known as the nayanmars and classified
         as Paadal Petra Sthalam.
